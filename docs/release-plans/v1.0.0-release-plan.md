```

### Steps

#### 1.1 Create Archive Directory Structure

```powershell
# Create temporary staging directory
$tempDir = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".\temp-archive-staging" -Force
$specsArchive = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$tempDir\specs" -Force
$docsArchive = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$tempDir\docs" -Force
```

**Verification:**
```powershell
Test-Path ".\temp-archive-staging\specs"  # Should return True
Test-Path ".\temp-archive-staging\docs"   # Should return True
```

#### 1.2 Copy Specs to Archive

```powershell
# Copy all 14 spec directories
Get-ChildItem -Path ".\specs" -Directory | ForEach-Object {
    Copy-Item -Path $_.FullName -Destination "$tempDir\specs\$($_.Name)" -Recurse -Force
}
```

**Verification:**
```powershell
# Should show 14 directories
(Get-ChildItem -Path "$tempDir\specs" -Directory).Count
```

#### 1.3 Copy Docs to Archive

```powershell
# Copy documentation directories
@('bugs', 'PRDs', 'research', 'workflows') | ForEach-Object {
    if (Test-Path ".\docs\$_") {
        Copy-Item -Path ".\docs\$_" -Destination "$tempDir\docs\$_" -Recurse -Force
    }
}

# Copy standalone documentation file
if (Test-Path ".\docs\GitHubApiClient-Implementation.md") {
    Copy-Item -Path ".\docs\GitHubApiClient-Implementation.md" -Destination "$tempDir\docs\" -Force
}
```

**Verification:**
```powershell
# Should show 4 directories + 1 file
Get-ChildItem -Path "$tempDir\docs"
```

#### 1.4 Create ZIP Archive

```powershell
# Create archive in specs directory
Compress-Archive -Path "$tempDir\*" -DestinationPath ".\specs\v1.0.0-archive.zip" -Force

# Verify archive created
if (Test-Path ".\specs\v1.0.0-archive.zip") {
    $archiveSize = (Get-Item ".\specs\v1.0.0-archive.zip").Length / 1MB
    Write-Host "✅ Archive created: v1.0.0-archive.zip ($([math]::Round($archiveSize, 2)) MB)"
} else {
    Write-Error "❌ Archive creation failed"
}
```

#### 1.5 Cleanup Staging Directory

```powershell
# Remove temporary staging directory
Remove-Item -Path ".\temp-archive-staging" -Recurse -Force
```

### Phase 1 Checklist

- [ ] Staging directory created successfully
- [ ] All 14 spec directories copied to staging
- [ ] All 5 docs directories + 1 file copied to staging
- [ ] ZIP archive created in `specs/v1.0.0-archive.zip`
- [ ] Archive size is reasonable (should be several MB)
- [ ] Staging directory cleaned up
- [ ] Archive can be extracted and contents verified

### Verification

```powershell
# Verify archive contents
Expand-Archive -Path ".\specs\v1.0.0-archive.zip" -DestinationPath ".\temp-verify" -Force
Get-ChildItem -Path ".\temp-verify" -Recurse
Remove-Item -Path ".\temp-verify" -Recurse -Force
```

**Expected Output:**
- `specs/` with 14 subdirectories
- `docs/bugs/` with 8 files
- `docs/PRDs/` with 7 files
- `docs/research/` with 2 files
- `docs/workflows/` with 1 file
- `docs/GitHubApiClient-Implementation.md`

---

## Phase 2: Cleanup Archived Content

**Status**: ⬜ Not Started

### Objective
Remove archived directories and files from repository, then create README files to explain v2.0 fresh start.

### Steps

#### 2.1 Delete Spec Directories

```powershell
# Delete all 14 spec directories
Get-ChildItem -Path ".\specs" -Directory | ForEach-Object {
    Remove-Item -Path $_.FullName -Recurse -Force
    Write-Host "Deleted: specs\$($_.Name)"
}
```

**Verification:**
```powershell
# Should only show v1.0.0-archive.zip
Get-ChildItem -Path ".\specs"
```

#### 2.2 Delete Docs Directories and Files

```powershell
# Delete documentation directories
@('bugs', 'PRDs', 'research', 'workflows') | ForEach-Object {
    if (Test-Path ".\docs\$_") {
        Remove-Item -Path ".\docs\$_" -Recurse -Force
        Write-Host "Deleted: docs\$_"
    }
}

# Delete standalone documentation file
if (Test-Path ".\docs\GitHubApiClient-Implementation.md") {
    Remove-Item -Path ".\docs\GitHubApiClient-Implementation.md" -Force
    Write-Host "Deleted: docs\GitHubApiClient-Implementation.md"
}
```

**Verification:**
```powershell
# Should only show release-plans directory (and any other non-archived docs)
Get-ChildItem -Path ".\docs"
```

#### 2.3 Create specs/README.md

Use `.specify\templates\readme-template.md` as a guide (simplified version):

**File**: `specs/README.md`

**Content Structure:**
```markdown
# SpecKit Feature Specifications (v2.0+)

> This directory contains feature specifications for v2.0 and future development.

## Overview

This directory houses all feature specifications created using the SpecKit workflow for version 2.0 and beyond. Each specification follows the SpecKit standard structure.

## v1.0 Archive

All v1.0 specifications (001-014) and related documentation have been archived in:
- **Archive File**: `v1.0.0-archive.zip`
- **Archive Date**: 2025-10-25
- **Contents**: 14 feature specs + documentation (bugs, PRDs, research, workflows)

To access v1.0 specifications, extract the archive:

```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path ".\specs\v1.0.0-archive.zip" -DestinationPath ".\specs\v1.0-archive"
```

## v2.0+ Development

For v2.0 and beyond, we start fresh with spec numbering:

### Creating a New Specification

1. **Specify**: Use `/speckit.specify` to create `specs/001-feature-name/spec.md`
2. **Plan**: Use `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
3. **Tasks**: Use `/speckit.tasks` to create actionable task breakdown
4. **Implement**: Use `/speckit.implement` or implement manually

### Specification Structure

Each spec directory should contain:
- `spec.md` - Complete feature specification
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `tasks.md` - Actionable task breakdown
- `data-model.md` - Data structures (if applicable)
- `checklists/` - Validation checklists (if applicable)
- `contracts/` - API contracts (if applicable)

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for development workflow and guidelines.

## Changelog

#### 2.4 Create docs/README.md

**File**: `docs/README.md`

**Content Structure:**
```markdown

## Phase 8: GitHub Release

**Status**: ⬜ Not Started

### Objective
Create GitHub Release from v1.0.0 tag with CHANGELOG content.

### Steps

#### 8.1 Navigate to GitHub Releases

1. Go to repository: https://github.com/NotMyself/claude-win11-speckit-update-skill
2. Click "Releases" (right sidebar)
3. Click "Draft a new release"

#### 8.2 Configure Release

**Choose a tag:**
- Select `v1.0.0` from dropdown (should appear after Phase 7)

```
v1.0.0 - Production Ready
```

**Description:**

Copy content from CHANGELOG.md [1.0.0] section, formatted for GitHub:

```markdown
## 🎉 v1.0.0 - Production Ready Milestone

This release marks the **production-ready milestone** for the SpecKit Safe Update Skill. The project is now stable and ready for widespread use.

### 🚀 What's New in v1.0.0

#### PR Validation Workflow Enhancement (#14)

Comprehensive automated PR validation with intelligent comment-based feedback:

##### 🔒 Security Scanning (Step 5)
- **GitLeaks secret detection**: API keys, tokens, passwords (100+ patterns)
- **PSScriptAnalyzer security rules**: Invoke-Expression, plain-text passwords
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning**: PowerShell modules against known CVEs
- **Path traversal detection**: Unsafe string concatenation, missing Join-Path

##### ✅ SpecKit Compliance Validation (Step 6)
- Spec directory structure validation (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
- Required section checking (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- CHANGELOG [Unreleased] detection
- Constitution compliance (Export-ModuleMember, no nested Import-Module)

##### 📏 PR Guardrails Enhancement (Step 2)
- PR size validation (2000 line limit with owner bypass)
- Description quality check (minimum 20 characters)

##### 🔍 Quality Checks Enhancement (Step 3)
- Linting results aggregation
- Test status reporting

##### 💬 Intelligent PR Comments
- Update-in-place behavior (no duplicate comments)
- HTML markers for reliable comment identification
- Structured findings with file:line references
- Remediation guidance for each issue
- Separate comments for each validation step (Steps 2-6)

##### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- Concurrency control (cancels in-progress runs on new commits)
- PSScriptAnalyzer module caching
- Timeout limits per step (prevents runaway jobs)

##### 📊 Non-blocking Design
- All validations informational (allows PRs to merge despite warnings)
- Progressive feedback for iterative fixes

##### 🧪 Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all validation scripts
- Complete workflow documentation in `docs/workflows/pr-validation.md`
