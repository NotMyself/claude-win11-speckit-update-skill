# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Version Parameter Handling in Update Orchestrator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec correctly focuses on WHAT needs to happen (fetch latest version, validate responses, show clear errors) without specifying HOW (no PowerShell implementation details beyond mentioning existing modules).

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- All 10 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria use measurable outcomes (e.g., "within 3 seconds", "95% of invocations", "100% of function calls")
- Edge cases cover API failures, timeouts, invalid data, and version scenarios
- Out of Scope section clearly defines what will NOT be implemented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Three prioritized user stories (P1: automatic updates, P2: error messages, P3: explicit version) cover the complete feature scope. Each story is independently testable.

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Quality Score**: 100% (15/15 checklist items passed)

**Recommendations**:
- Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and unambiguous
- Consider using `/speckit.checklist` to create custom validation checklists for specific testing needs

## Notes

This is a bug fix specification based on issue #6. The spec successfully transforms the bug report into a feature specification that:
- Focuses on user outcomes (automatic version detection, clear error messages)
- Avoids implementation details (no mention of specific PowerShell cmdlets or code structure)
- Provides measurable success criteria (95% success rate, 3-second error feedback)
- Clearly defines scope with 3 independently testable user stories
