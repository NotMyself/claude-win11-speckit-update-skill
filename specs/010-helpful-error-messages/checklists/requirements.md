# Specification Quality Checklist: Helpful Error Messages for Non-SpecKit Projects

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items validated successfully

**Validated**: 2025-10-22

**Summary**:
- Content Quality: 4/4 items passed
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 items passed
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 items passed

**Key Strengths**:
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- All 7 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) cover all primary user flows
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are fully specified
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (6 scenarios identified)
- Clear scope boundaries with 7 items explicitly out of scope

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

## Notes

- Specification successfully validated on first iteration
- No clarifications needed - all requirements derived from detailed PRD
- Feature can proceed directly to planning phase
