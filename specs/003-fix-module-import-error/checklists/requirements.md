# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Fatal Module Import Error

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Created**: 2025-10-20

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED ✓

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Detailed Review:

**Content Quality**:
- Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of specific PowerShell cmdlets or code structure in requirements)
- Focused on user value: skill must execute, provide clean output, maintain error handling
- Written accessibly: uses plain language to describe what users and maintainers need
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- No clarification markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Each requirement is testable (e.g., "completes in under 2 seconds", "zero false-positive errors")
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (100% success rate, <2 seconds, zero errors)
- Success criteria avoid implementation (focus on execution success, not how modules are loaded)
- All user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases cover different PowerShell hosts, execution policies, error conditions
- Scope clearly separates in-scope (error handling fixes) from out-of-scope (refactoring)
- Dependencies (PowerShell 7.x, Claude Code) and assumptions (execution policies, file access) documented

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and success criteria
- User stories progress logically: P1 (basic execution) → P2 (clean output) → P3 (maintainability)
- Success criteria align with user needs without specifying implementation approach
- Specification maintains abstraction - describes what needs to work, not how to fix it

## Notes

The specification is well-structured for a bug fix feature. It successfully translates technical implementation details from the bug report into user-facing requirements and measurable outcomes. Ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
