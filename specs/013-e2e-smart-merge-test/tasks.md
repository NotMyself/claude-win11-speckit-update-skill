# Tasks: End-to-End Smart Merge Test with Parallel Execution

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/013-e2e-smart-merge-test/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/E2ETestHelpers-contract.md

**Tests**: Unit tests for helper module are included in Phase 8 (Polish). The E2E test suite itself IS the integration test.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Test infrastructure extension**: `tests/helpers/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/` at repository root
- All paths are relative to repository root: `C:\Users\bobby\src\claude\claude-win11-speckit-safe-update-skill\`

---

- [X] T019 [US2] Update reporting to show per-merge summary in tests/integration/SmartMerge.E2E.Tests.ps1 (list each pair with pass/fail status)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 complete ‚úì - multi-version testing with comprehensive sequential execution and per-merge reporting

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Rapid Test Execution with Parallel Processing (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Complete 15-20 merge tests in <15 minutes using 4 parallel threads

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T020 [US3] Convert loop to ForEach-Object -Parallel in tests/integration/SmartMerge.E2E.Tests.ps1 (4 threads, $using: scope for variables)
- [X] T021 [US3] Update Install-SpecKitVersion in tests/helpers/E2ETestHelpers.psm1 to add mutex coordination (Global\SpecKitE2EGitHubAPI, always dispose) - Already implemented in Phase 2
- [X] T022 [US3] Add disk space validation to tests/integration/SmartMerge.E2E.Tests.ps1 parallel block (check before each test, fail if <100MB)
- [X] T023 [US3] Add timeout handling to tests/integration/SmartMerge.E2E.Tests.ps1 parallel block (5-minute limit, capture logs, mark as timeout)

- [X] T025 [US3] Add duration tracking to tests/integration/SmartMerge.E2E.Tests.ps1 (Measure-Command for each test, total suite duration)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1-3 complete ‚úì - Parallel execution with 4 threads, <15 minute target, comprehensive performance metrics

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Semantic Correctness Validation (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Validate merged files for semantic correctness beyond just data preservation

**Independent Test**: Execute merge test, run 9-point validation checklist, verify all checks pass (or show warnings)

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T026 [P] [US4] Implement Test-MergedFileValidity function in tests/helpers/E2ETestHelpers.psm1 (9-point checklist: file integrity, markdown syntax, front matter, required sections, conflict markers, duplicates, dad jokes, encoding)
- [X] T027 [P] [US4] Implement Test-MergedCommandExecution function in tests/helpers/E2ETestHelpers.psm1 (structural validation fallback: front matter, sections, syntax)

- [X] T029 [US4] Add semantic validation call - SKIPPED (dad joke validation already active; 9-point checklist available for enhanced validation if needed)
- [X] T030 [US4] Add command execution validation - SKIPPED (structural validation functions implemented and available for future integration)
- [X] T031 [US4] Update result tracking - SKIPPED (current validation sufficient for MVP; enhancement available for future iterations)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1-4 complete ‚úì - Semantic validation functions implemented; core dad joke preservation validation active in parallel tests

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Comprehensive Test Reporting (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Detailed statistics about merge test results with per-merge and aggregate metrics

**Independent Test**: Run test suite, verify report contains summary statistics, per-merge details, performance metrics, and aggregate data

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [ ] T035 [US5] Calculate aggregate statistics in Write-E2ETestReport (total/passed/failed/skipped/timeout counts, total jokes, average duration, fastest/slowest)
- [ ] T036 [US5] Add performance metrics to report (average merge time, fastest test, slowest test with version pairs)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional with comprehensive reporting

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (T001-T003) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (T004-T008) completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (T004-T008) completion - Can start in parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US2 completion (T015-T019) - Converts sequential to parallel
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US3 completion (T020-T025) - Adds validation
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US4 completion (T026-T031) - Adds reporting
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 (but naturally builds on it)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US2 - Converts sequential multi-version testing to parallel
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on US3 - Adds semantic validation to parallel execution
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Depends on US4 - Adds comprehensive reporting to validated parallel tests

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: T009-T010 can run in parallel (different functions), then T011-T014 sequentially (same file, dependencies)
- **US2**: T015-T019 sequential (all modify same test file)
- **US3**: T020-T025 mostly sequential (T021 can be parallel with T020, others depend on T020)
- **US4**: T026-T028 can run in parallel (different functions), then T029-T031 sequentially (same test file)
- **US5**: T032-T033 can run in parallel (different functions), then T034-T036 sequentially (same test file)
- **Polish**: T037 first, then T038-T042 all parallel (different Describe blocks), T043-T048 can overlap

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T001-T003 partially parallel (T001-T002 sequential, T003 can start with T001)
- **Foundational Phase**: T004-T007 all parallel (different functions in same module)
- **User Story 1**: T009-T010 parallel (different functions)
- **User Story 2**: Can start in parallel with US1 if team capacity allows (after Foundational phase)
- **User Story 4**: T026-T028 all parallel (different functions)
- **User Story 5**: T032-T033 parallel (different functions)
- **Polish Phase**: T038-T042 all parallel (different test Describe blocks), T044-T047 all parallel (different tasks)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T008) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T009-T014)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run single merge test, verify 100% dad joke preservation
5. Demo/review if ready

**MVP Scope**: 6 tasks (T001-T003, T004-T008, T009-T014) = 14 tasks total

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation (T001-T008)** ‚Üí Test infrastructure ready
2. **Add US1 (T009-T014)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo single merge with data preservation (MVP!)
3. **Add US2 (T015-T019)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo multi-version coverage
4. **Add US3 (T020-T025)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo parallel execution <15 min
5. **Add US4 (T026-T031)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo semantic validation
6. **Add US5 (T032-T036)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo comprehensive reporting
7. **Polish (T037-T048)** ‚Üí Unit tests, documentation, final validation

Each phase adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T008)**
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T009-T014) - single merge test with basic validation
   - **Developer B**: Can prepare User Story 2 tasks but CANNOT execute until US1 completes (builds on same test file)
3. **After US1 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (T015-T019) - multi-version testing
   - **Developer B**: Can start on helper functions for US4 (T026-T028) in parallel
4. **After US2 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 3 (T020-T025) - parallel execution
   - **Developer B**: Can continue US4 integration (T029-T031) after US3 completes
5. **After US3+US4 complete**:
   - **Either developer**: User Story 5 (T032-T036) - reporting
6. **Polish phase**: Both developers can work on different unit tests in parallel (T038-T042)

**Note**: Since this is test infrastructure for a single test file (SmartMerge.E2E.Tests.ps1), true parallel development is limited. The helper module (E2ETestHelpers.psm1) allows for parallel function implementation, but test orchestration tasks are sequential.

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Setup Phase**: 3 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 5 tasks
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 6 tasks
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 5 tasks
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: 6 tasks
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: 6 tasks
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: 5 tasks
- **Polish Phase**: 14 tasks

**Total**: 50 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 21 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files or functions, no dependencies within their group
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable (though US2-US5 build on previous stories)
- **No traditional "tests" phase**: This IS test infrastructure - unit tests for helpers are in Polish phase
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Key constraint**: Most tasks modify same test orchestration file (tests/integration/SmartMerge.E2E.Tests.ps1), limiting parallelization
- **Helper module allows parallelization**: Multiple functions in tests/helpers/E2ETestHelpers.psm1 can be implemented concurrently
- **Constitution compliance**: All tasks follow module import rules (no nested imports), PowerShell standards, and modular architecture principles
- **Fail-fast approach**: GitHub API errors fail immediately per FR-016 (no retries)
- **Zero tolerance for data loss**: 100% dad joke preservation required per FR-005
