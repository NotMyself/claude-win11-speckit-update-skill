# Tasks: PR Validation Workflow Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/014-pr-validation-enhancement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per project constitution (Principle V: Testing Discipline). All validation scripts MUST have corresponding Pester unit tests.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Validation scripts: `.github/scripts/`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
- Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/`
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
- Documentation: `docs/workflows/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and directory structure

- [ ] T001 Create `.github/scripts/` directory for validation scripts
- [ ] T002 Create `tests/fixtures/vulnerable-code-samples/` directory for security test data
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `tests/fixtures/spec-structures/` directory for spec validation test data
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `tests/fixtures/pr-comment-examples/` directory for expected comment outputs
- [ ] T005 [P] Create `docs/workflows/` directory for workflow documentation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core PR comment infrastructure that ALL user stories depend on. This implements User Story 4 (Comment Update-in-Place) behavior as foundational requirement.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story validation work can begin until this phase is complete

### Comment Formatter

- [ ] T006 [P] Create `format-pr-comment.ps1` script in `.github/scripts/` with JSON input parsing
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement Markdown formatting logic in `format-pr-comment.ps1` (status indicators, sections, timestamps)
- [ ] T008 Implement HTML marker generation in `format-pr-comment.ps1` (format: `<!-- pr-validation:step-N -->`)
- [ ] T009 [P] Create `FormatPRComment.Tests.ps1` in `tests/unit/` to test comment formatting
- [ ] T010 [P] Add test fixtures for comment formatter in `tests/fixtures/pr-comment-examples/` (pass, warning, failed scenarios)

### Comment Posting Infrastructure (User Story 4 Implementation)

- [ ] T011 [US4] Create reusable GitHub Actions workflow step for posting/updating PR comments in `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
- [ ] T012 [US4] Implement comment search logic using HTML markers (find existing comment by marker)
- [ ] T013 [US4] Implement update-in-place logic (update existing comment if found, create if not)
- [ ] T014 [US4] Add permissions block to workflow (`pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`)
- [ ] T015 [P] [US4] Create test fixture PR comment examples showing update behavior in `tests/fixtures/pr-comment-examples/update-scenarios/`

### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] T016 [P] Create sample vulnerable code in `tests/fixtures/vulnerable-code-samples/` (API key, Invoke-Expression, path concatenation)
- [ ] T017 [P] Create valid spec structure in `tests/fixtures/spec-structures/valid-spec/` (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
- [ ] T018 [P] Create invalid spec structures in `tests/fixtures/spec-structures/` (missing-tasks, missing-changelog, etc.)

- [ ] T098 [P] Add timeout limits to each validation step (prevent runaway jobs)
- [ ] T099 Add validation summary job at end of `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` (aggregates all step results)

### Edge Case Handling

- [ ] T100 [P] Add error handling for validation step failures in workflow (post error comment on network timeout)
- [ ] T101 [P] Implement output truncation in `format-pr-comment.ps1` (max 5000 lines, link to full logs)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Integration verification only - depends on US1, US2, US5 completion
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Implemented in Foundational phase (T011-T015) - BLOCKS all other stories (comment infrastructure must exist first)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach per constitution)
- Validation scripts before workflow integration
- Unit tests before integration tests
- Story complete and verified before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks T001-T005 can run in parallel (different directories)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
  - T006-T008 (format-pr-comment.ps1) can run in parallel with T016-T018 (test fixtures)
  - T009-T010 (formatter tests) depend on T006-T008 completion
- **Phase 3 (US1)**:
  - Tests T019-T022 can all run in parallel (different test files)
  - Implementation: T023-T026 (dependency script) parallel with T028-T033 (path security script)
  - Integration tests T044-T048 can run in parallel after implementation complete
- **Phase 4 (US2)**:
  - Tests T049-T053 can all run in parallel
  - Workflow T065-T069 can start once T054-T064 (script) complete
- **Phase 5 (US5)**:
  - Steps 2 and 3 modifications can run in parallel (T074-T078 and T079-T081)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**:
  - All documentation tasks T091-T095 can run in parallel
  - All optimization tasks T096-T098 can run in parallel
  - All edge case tasks T100-T103 can run in parallel
- **Cross-Story Parallelization**: Once Foundational completes, US1, US2, US5 can all start in parallel (different scripts/steps)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create CheckDependencies.Tests.ps1 in tests/unit/"
Task: "Create CheckPathSecurity.Tests.ps1 in tests/unit/"
Task: "Create test case in CheckPathSecurity.Tests.ps1 for safe Join-Path usage"
Task: "Create test case in CheckDependencies.Tests.ps1 for current safe versions"

# Launch validation script implementations in parallel:
Task: "Create check-dependencies.ps1 in .github/scripts/"
Task: "Create check-path-security.ps1 in .github/scripts/"

# Launch integration tests in parallel after implementation:
Task: "Add test case for GitLeaks secret detection in integration test"
Task: "Add test case for PSScriptAnalyzer security rule violation"
Task: "Add test case for dependency vulnerability in integration test"
Task: "Add test case for path traversal detection in integration test"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### User Story 1 First

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005) → Directory structure ready
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T018, CRITICAL) → Comment infrastructure ready
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T048) → Security scanning ready
4. Test and validate:
   - Run `./tests/test-runner.ps1 -Unit` → All US1 tests pass
   - Submit test PR with security issue → Comment appears with findings
   - Push fix → Comment updates (not duplicates)
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready for all stories
2. Add User Story 1 (Security) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 2 (Spec Compliance) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 5 (Size/Description) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Validate User Story 3 (Integration) → All comments working together
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Security scanning)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Spec compliance)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Size/description comments)
3. Stories complete independently, validate US3 integration together
4. Team completes Polish phase together

**Polish Tasks**: 19 (T091-T109, includes 5 edge case tasks T100-T104)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 39 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
**Independent Stories**: US1, US2, US5 can all run in parallel after Foundational phase

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD per constitution)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Constitution requires tests for all modules - test tasks are mandatory, not optional
- JSON schemas in contracts/ provide validation for all script outputs
- Use quickstart.md as reference when implementing validation scripts
