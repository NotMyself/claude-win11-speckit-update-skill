# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete Parameter Standardization for Manifest Creation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Iterations**: 1

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on the parameter renaming requirement without mentioning PowerShell-specific implementation details beyond necessary context (e.g., function names, parameter syntax which are part of the user interface)

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate value - P1 unblocks new users, P2 ensures maintainability, P3 improves documentation

✅ **Non-technical clarity**: Written in plain language describing what needs to happen and why, avoiding technical jargon where possible

✅ **All mandatory sections**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria all completed with substantial detail

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: The spec contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are specific and clear.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each of the 10 functional requirements is verifiable:
- FR-001 to FR-005: Can verify by inspecting code
- FR-006: Testable via regression tests with existing manifests
- FR-007: Testable via null parameter test cases
- FR-008 to FR-010: Testable via test suite execution

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 7 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: Success = no errors (binary outcome)
- SC-002: 5 code locations updated (count-based)
- SC-003: Zero occurrences (count-based)
- SC-004: All tests pass (binary outcome)
- SC-005: 100% of 4 test cases pass (percentage)
- SC-006: Same completion time (performance metric)
- SC-007: Help command shows correct docs (binary outcome)

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: While the feature inherently involves PowerShell parameters, the success criteria focus on user outcomes (can run commands without errors, documentation is correct) rather than implementation details

✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has 2-3 Given/When/Then scenarios covering the primary flows

✅ **Edge cases identified**: Four edge cases documented covering API failures, backward compatibility, interruptions, and version mismatches

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly lists what won't be done (aliases, refactoring, new features, performance optimization)

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: Both sections present with 5 assumptions and 3 dependencies clearly documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: The acceptance scenarios in user stories map to functional requirements (e.g., US1 scenarios validate FR-001, FR-002, FR-007)

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: Three user stories at P1, P2, P3 cover the bug fix, consistency improvement, and documentation update respectively

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Seven success criteria provide clear pass/fail conditions for feature completion

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The spec maintains focus on what needs to change and why, not how to implement it

## Notes

- The specification is complete and ready for planning
- No issues found during validation
- All checklist items passed on first iteration
- The spec can proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase
