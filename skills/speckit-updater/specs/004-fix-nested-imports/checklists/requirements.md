# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Module Function Availability

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is ready for planning.

### Content Quality Assessment

- ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT (module functions must be available) not HOW (no PowerShell implementation details like scope resolution)
- ✅ Written for developers maintaining the skill (user value: working skill, clear architecture)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (root cause is clear from bug report)
- ✅ Requirements are testable:
  - FR-001: Verify with `Get-Command -Module [ModuleName]`
  - FR-002: Scan codebase for `Import-Module` in `.psm1` files
  - FR-003: Check orchestrator import order matches dependency graph
  - All FRs have clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
  - SC-001: "100% skill execution success rate" (quantitative, user-facing)
  - SC-003: "Zero `.psm1` files contain Import-Module" (quantitative, verifiable)
  - SC-006: "Code review checklist includes verification" (qualitative, process metric)
- ✅ Edge cases address boundary conditions (dependency order, circular dependencies, backward compatibility)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded: Out of Scope section lists what's NOT included
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions documented in dedicated sections

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios:
  - FR-001-005: Map to User Story 1 (working skill)
  - FR-002-003: Map to User Story 2 (clean architecture)
  - FR-006-007: Map to User Story 3 (constitution updates)
- ✅ User scenarios cover all critical paths (P1: basic execution, P2: maintainability, P3: governance)
- ✅ Success criteria align with user value (100% execution success, zero regressions)

## Next Steps

Specification is ready for:
- `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan with design artifacts
- `/speckit.clarify` - Optional if additional questions arise during planning

## Notes

- Bug report provides comprehensive root cause analysis, eliminating need for clarification questions
- Fix addresses regression from PR #3 while preserving its correct behavior (no Export-ModuleMember in helpers)
- Architecture aligns with PowerShell best practices (centralized dependency management)
