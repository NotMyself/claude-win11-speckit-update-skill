# Feature Specification: GitHub Personal Access Token Support

**Feature Branch**: `012-github-token-support`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "GitHub Personal Access Token Support for Rate Limit Avoidance"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Backward Compatible Operation (Priority: P1)

Users can run the updater immediately without any token configuration, maintaining current behavior while benefiting from optional authentication.

**Why this priority**: Ensures zero breaking changes and preserves the existing user experience. New users can evaluate the skill without setup friction, while existing users continue working without interruption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `/speckit-update` without setting GITHUB_TOKEN and verifying it works exactly as before, delivers same functionality with 60 requests/hour limit.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh installation without GITHUB_TOKEN set, **When** user runs `/speckit-update -CheckOnly`, **Then** update check completes successfully with no errors or warnings about missing token
2. **Given** GITHUB_TOKEN is not set, **When** user runs update for first time, **Then** system uses unauthenticated requests and completes normally within rate limit
3. **Given** user has never heard of GitHub tokens, **When** they use the updater, **Then** they experience no friction or confusing token-related messages

---

### User Story 2 - Developer Testing Workflow (Priority: P1)

Developers working on the updater can make multiple test runs without hitting rate limits, enabling rapid iteration and validation.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintainability and development velocity. Without this, testing changes becomes painful with 60-minute wait periods after just 3-4 test runs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting GITHUB_TOKEN once, making 20 consecutive update runs within an hour, and verifying all succeed with authenticated requests at 5,000/hour limit.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer sets GITHUB_TOKEN in PowerShell session, **When** they run `/speckit-update -CheckOnly` multiple times, **Then** all requests use authentication and no rate limiting occurs
2. **Given** developer has valid GitHub token, **When** they make 20 test runs in one hour, **Then** all 20 runs complete successfully without rate limit errors
3. **Given** developer uses verbose mode, **When** command runs with token set, **Then** output shows "Using authenticated request (rate limit: 5,000 req/hour)" without exposing token value

---

### User Story 3 - Team in Shared Office Network (Priority: P2)

Team members sharing the same office IP address can each use their personal GitHub tokens, eliminating rate limit conflicts between colleagues.

**Why this priority**: Improves team productivity by decoupling individual rate limits from shared IP address. Common pain point in office environments where one person's usage blocks others.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having two team members on same network each set their own GITHUB_TOKEN and run updates simultaneously, verifying both succeed independently with separate 5,000/hour limits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** three developers on same office network each with their own token, **When** each runs 10 updates in an hour, **Then** all 30 updates succeed (10 per person) without rate conflicts
2. **Given** developer A exhausts their rate limit, **When** developer B runs update with different token, **Then** developer B's request succeeds unaffected by developer A's limit
3. **Given** team members work independently, **When** each sets their GITHUB_TOKEN, **Then** no coordination is needed between team members

---

### User Story 4 - CI/CD Pipeline Integration (Priority: P2)

DevOps engineers can integrate SpecKit updates into automated workflows using GitHub tokens from CI secrets, enabling reliable template validation on every commit.

**Why this priority**: Enables automation and continuous validation. CI/CD environments share runner IPs and would quickly hit unauthenticated rate limits without token support.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting up GitHub Actions workflow with GITHUB_TOKEN from secrets, running update check in pipeline, and verifying authenticated requests work in automation context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** GitHub Actions workflow with GITHUB_TOKEN from secrets, **When** workflow runs update check, **Then** authenticated request succeeds with 5,000/hour limit
2. **Given** CI pipeline runs hourly checks, **When** multiple runs occur within same hour, **Then** all runs succeed without rate limiting
3. **Given** DevOps engineer reads documentation, **When** they set up token in CI environment, **Then** setup works with examples provided for GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, and Jenkins

### User Story 5 - Helpful Rate Limit Guidance (Priority: P3)

Users who hit rate limits receive actionable guidance on setting up token authentication to resolve the issue.

**Why this priority**: Improves discoverability and user education. Transforms frustrating rate limit errors into learning opportunities that guide users toward the solution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making 61 unauthenticated requests to trigger rate limit, verifying error message suggests setting GITHUB_TOKEN with documentation link.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user hits rate limit without token set, **When** error occurs, **Then** message explains rate limiting and suggests "Set GITHUB_TOKEN to increase rate limit from 60 to 5,000 requests/hour"
2. **Given** user sees rate limit error message, **When** they follow documentation link, **Then** they find clear step-by-step instructions for creating and setting token
3. **Given** user already has token set, **When** they hit rate limit (rare), **Then** error message does NOT suggest setting token (already using one)

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when token is invalid or expired?** System attempts request with invalid token, GitHub API returns 401 Unauthorized error, user sees clear error message about authentication failure, can remove or fix token
- **What happens when token is malformed?** System sends malformed Authorization header, GitHub returns 401, user sees authentication error and can correct token format
- **What happens when rate limit is hit even with token?** (5,000+ requests in one hour) System shows rate limit error with reset time but does NOT suggest setting token since one is already in use
- **What happens when token environment variable is empty string?** System treats empty string same as unset variable, uses unauthenticated requests
- **What happens when verbose mode is used?** System logs authentication status ("Using authenticated request" or "Using unauthenticated request") with rate limit information but never logs actual token value
- **What happens when user sets token mid-session?** Next invocation of updater picks up new token value from environment, switches to authenticated requests automatically
- **What happens when token is accidentally committed to Git?** Environment variable storage prevents this - tokens never written to manifest.json, config files, or any tracked files
- **What happens when GitHub changes token format?** System doesn't validate format, just passes token to GitHub API, so format changes are handled automatically by GitHub
- **What happens when GitHub API changes authentication method?** Current implementation uses standard OAuth Bearer format recommended by GitHub, minimal future-proofing needed
- **What happens in network proxy environments?** Token is sent in HTTP headers same as other requests, works through proxies that already allow api.github.com access

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-007**: System MUST NOT suggest setting token in rate limit errors when token is already being used
- **FR-008**: System MUST accept GitHub Personal Access Tokens in standard format (ghp_ prefix with 36 alphanumeric characters)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle invalid tokens gracefully by allowing GitHub API to return 401 Unauthorized errors, surfacing clear authentication failure messages to users without pre-validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST work identically in both PowerShell sessions and CI/CD environments that provide GITHUB_TOKEN via secrets
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain current exit codes and error handling behavior (Exit Code 3 for API errors)
- **FR-012**: System MUST not store tokens in manifest.json, configuration files, or any persisted state
- **FR-013**: System MUST support users changing tokens mid-session by picking up new environment variable value on next invocation
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide verbose logging that allows developers to verify authentication status without exposing secrets
- **FR-015**: System MUST include documentation link in rate limit error messages pointing to token setup instructions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Credential provided by GitHub that authenticates API requests, format is `ghp_` prefix followed by 36 alphanumeric characters, stored only in environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`, never persisted to files
- **Authentication Status**: Runtime state indicating whether current request will be authenticated (token present) or unauthenticated (token absent), affects rate limit quotas (5,000 vs 60 requests/hour), logged in verbose mode only
- **Rate Limit Response**: Information returned by GitHub API via headers (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset), used to determine if 403 error is rate limiting and when limit resets, displayed to users in error messages

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes
