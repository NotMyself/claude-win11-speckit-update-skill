# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Module Import Error

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Content Quality Assessment

- **Implementation Details**: Specification avoids PowerShell-specific implementation. References to "PowerShell 7.x" and "modules" are environmental prerequisites, not implementation choices.
- **User Value Focus**: All three user stories focus on outcomes (skill works, clean output, helpful errors) rather than technical solutions.
- **Stakeholder Language**: Uses business terms like "blocking functionality," "user confidence," and "actionable error messages."
- **Completeness**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- **Clarification Markers**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements have clear, definitive statements.
- **Testability**: All 10 functional requirements are testable (can verify module import, function availability, error message content, execution success).
- **Success Criteria Measurability**: All 7 success criteria include specific metrics (100% success rate, under 2 seconds, zero false positives, within 1 second).
- **Technology Agnostic Success Criteria**: SC-001 through SC-007 describe user-observable outcomes without specifying how they are implemented.
- **Acceptance Scenarios**: 10 total scenarios across 3 user stories, each with Given-When-Then format.
- **Edge Cases**: 6 edge cases identified covering non-terminating errors, partial loads, version incompatibility, warnings, profile interference, and host variations.
- **Scope Boundaries**: Feature is bounded to module import phase only, not the entire skill functionality.
- **Dependencies**: Assumptions section lists 6 key dependencies including PowerShell version, module structure, and error handling approach.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- **Requirements to Acceptance Mapping**: Each FR (FR-001 through FR-010) maps to at least one acceptance scenario across the three user stories.
- **User Scenario Coverage**: Three user stories cover the complete flow: P1 (skill must work), P2 (clean experience), P3 (helpful errors).
- **Measurable Outcomes**: All success criteria can be verified through testing (execution success, timing, error counts, message content).
- **No Implementation Leakage**: While the spec mentions PowerShell concepts (modules, functions), these are inherent to the problem domain (fixing a PowerShell skill), not implementation choices for a new feature.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No follow-up actions required
- All quality gates passed on first validation iteration
