# Feature Specification: Plugin-Based Distribution

**Feature Branch**: `015-plugin-distribution`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "docs\PRDs\006-Plugin-Based-Distribution.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - First-Time Installation (Priority: P1)

A developer discovering the SpecKit Safe Update Skill for the first time wants to install it quickly to evaluate whether it meets their needs without spending time on complex setup procedures.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical user journey because first impressions determine adoption. A frictionless installation experience directly impacts whether users will try and adopt the skill. This delivers immediate value by reducing installation from multi-step manual process to two simple commands.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting with a clean environment (no existing installation), running two commands (`/plugin marketplace add` and `/plugin install`), and verifying the skill is immediately usable with `/speckit-update --check-only`. Success means the user can start using the skill within 30 seconds without touching the file system manually.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has Claude Code installed but no SpecKit updater skill, **When** they run `/plugin marketplace add NotMyself/claude-plugins` followed by `/plugin install speckit-updater`, **Then** the skill installs successfully and appears in their `/help` command list
2. **Given** the skill is freshly installed via plugin, **When** the user navigates to a SpecKit project and runs `/speckit-update --check-only`, **Then** the command executes successfully and shows update status
3. **Given** a user runs `/plugin` after adding the marketplace, **When** they review the output, **Then** they see `speckit-updater` listed with its version and description
4. **Given** installation is in progress, **When** the user waits for completion, **Then** installation completes within 30 seconds (excluding network latency)
5. **Given** a user has no prior knowledge of the skill's file structure, **When** they install via plugin, **Then** no manual file system operations are required

### User Story 2 - Team Standardization (Priority: P2)

A team lead adopting SpecKit wants to share simple, repeatable installation instructions with team members so everyone uses the same version without requiring detailed setup documentation or manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Team adoption is a key driver for tool standardization and requires minimal friction. This delivers value by reducing onboarding time from 5-10 minutes (finding repo, understanding structure, cloning correctly) to 30 seconds, and ensures version consistency across team members.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sharing two commands with multiple team members who have different experience levels. Success means all team members install the identical version without asking clarification questions and can immediately use the skill in their projects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team lead wants to onboard team members, **When** they share two commands (`/plugin marketplace add` and `/plugin install`), **Then** team members can complete installation without additional documentation
2. **Given** multiple team members install the plugin at different times, **When** they check their installed version, **Then** all team members have the identical version installed
3. **Given** a team member completes installation, **When** they run `/speckit-update --check-only` in a SpecKit project, **Then** the behavior is identical across all team members regardless of their operating system
4. **Given** team onboarding documentation includes the two-command installation, **When** new team members follow the instructions, **Then** onboarding time is reduced by at least 80% compared to manual Git clone instructions

### User Story 3 - Existing User Migration (Priority: P3)

A user with an existing manual Git clone installation wants to optionally migrate to the plugin-based installation method to benefit from version management and easier updates, without losing any functionality or customizations.

**Why this priority**: This is lower priority because existing users already have working installations. Migration is optional and provides incremental benefits (version management, easier updates) rather than critical functionality. It enables users to benefit from plugin features at their own pace.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting with a working manual installation, removing it, installing via plugin, and verifying identical behavior. Success means the skill works identically after migration with no data loss or configuration changes required.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has an existing manual installation at `$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\speckit-updater`, **When** the user continues using it after the plugin distribution release, **Then** the skill continues to work without any breaking changes
2. **Given** a user decides to migrate to plugin installation, **When** they follow the migration guide (remove manual installation, install via plugin), **Then** the migration completes successfully and all commands work identically
3. **Given** a user completes migration from manual to plugin, **When** they run `/speckit-update` in their SpecKit projects, **Then** behavior is identical to their previous manual installation
4. **Given** a user is uncertain about migration, **When** they review the migration documentation, **Then** clear guidance explains the optional nature and benefits of migration

### User Story 4 - Future Skills Discovery (Priority: P3)

A user who installed `speckit-updater` via plugin wants to discover other SpecKit-related skills available in the same marketplace to expand their workflow automation capabilities.

**Why this priority**: This is lower priority because it depends on future skills being developed and added to the marketplace. It provides value for ecosystem growth but isn't critical for the initial plugin distribution launch. This sets the foundation for distributing multiple related tools.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `/plugin` after the marketplace is added and verifying that all available skills are listed with descriptions. Success means users can browse the marketplace and install additional skills as they become available.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has the NotMyself marketplace added, **When** they run `/plugin`, **Then** they see a list of all available skills with names, versions, and descriptions
2. **Given** additional skills are added to the marketplace in the future, **When** a user runs `/plugin`, **Then** the new skills appear in the browsable list automatically
3. **Given** a user wants to install multiple SpecKit-related skills, **When** they run `/plugin install` for each skill name, **Then** all skills install successfully from the same marketplace
4. **Given** the marketplace README is accessible on GitHub, **When** users visit the repository, **Then** comprehensive documentation explains all available skills and their features

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a user has both manual and plugin installations?** System should detect the conflict and either warn the user or prioritize plugin installation (Claude Code loading behavior determines precedence).
- **What happens if marketplace.json is malformed or contains invalid JSON?** Plugin system should display a clear error message indicating the marketplace cannot be loaded, and existing installations should continue working.
- **What happens when repository restructuring breaks relative paths in existing code?** All relative paths must be validated during testing phase, and backward compatibility tests must verify manual installations continue working.
- **What happens if GitHub is unreachable during plugin installation?** Installation should fail gracefully with a clear error message about network connectivity, and the user should be able to retry later.
- **What happens if plugin.json and marketplace.json have version mismatches?** The plugin system should use the version specified in plugin.json as the source of truth, but marketplace maintainers should ensure versions are synchronized during releases.
- **What happens if the plugin installation is interrupted mid-process?** Installation should be idempotent, allowing the user to safely re-run `/plugin install` to complete the installation.
- **What happens when a user tries to update via plugin but is still using manual installation?** Manual installations must continue using `git pull` for updates; plugin update commands should not affect manual installations.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST enable installation via `/plugin install speckit-updater` command after marketplace is added
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a marketplace manifest that contains plugin metadata (name, version, description, author, repository URL, requirements)
- **FR-003**: System MUST complete plugin installation in less than 30 seconds, excluding network latency for downloading repository content
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing manual Git clone installations (no breaking changes to functionality, commands, or skill loading; Git clone URL remains unchanged and manual installations continue working from restructured repository)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support version management through plugin manifest, allowing users to see installed version and potential updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST restructure repository to support plugin format (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/` directory) without breaking existing manual installations
- **FR-007**: System MUST make installed skill immediately available after installation completes (appears in `/help` output and is executable)
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable marketplace browsing via `/plugin` command, displaying all available plugins with descriptions
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide plugin prerequisite metadata (PowerShell 7+, Git 2.0+) in plugin manifest; Claude Code plugin system validates during installation and displays clear error messages if requirements are not met
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide plugin metadata including homepage URL, repository URL, license, keywords, and changelog link
- **FR-011**: System MUST support optional migration from manual to plugin installation without data loss or configuration changes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Plugin Manifest**: Declares plugin metadata for the SpecKit Safe Update Skill. Contains name (`speckit-updater`), semantic version, description, author information, repository details, license, skills directory path (`./skills/` which contains `speckit-updater/` subdirectory), prerequisites (PowerShell, Git versions), keywords for discoverability, and changelog URL.

- **Marketplace Manifest**: Catalog of available Claude Code plugins in the NotMyself marketplace. Contains marketplace metadata (name `notmyself-plugins`, description, author, version) and an array of plugin entries that reference plugin repositories with their metadata (name, description, version, source repository, author, homepage, tags, requirements).

- **Skill Content**: The SpecKit Safe Update Skill's operational files, restructured under the `skills/speckit-updater/` directory. Includes the skill definition (`SKILL.md`), PowerShell scripts (`scripts/` directory), test suites (`tests/` directory), templates (`templates/` directory), specifications (`specs/` directory), and fingerprint database (`data/` directory). All relationships between these files remain unchanged; only the directory structure wrapper changes.
