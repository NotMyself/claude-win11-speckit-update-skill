# Specification Quality Checklist: Plugin-Based Distribution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: âœ… All checklist items passed

**Specification Quality**: Excellent
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3, P3) with independent test criteria
- 11 functional requirements, all testable and technology-agnostic
- 9 success criteria with measurable metrics
- 3 key entities (Plugin Manifest, Marketplace Manifest, Skill Content)
- 7 comprehensive edge cases identified
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers required - PRD was extremely detailed

**Readiness**: Ready for `/speckit.plan`

**Key Strengths**:
1. Each user story includes "Why this priority" and "Independent Test" sections
2. All success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
3. Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of JSON files, Git operations, etc.)
4. Functional requirements focus on WHAT not HOW
5. Edge cases cover real-world scenarios (conflicts, errors, network issues)
6. Backward compatibility explicitly addressed throughout

**No issues found** - specification is complete and ready for planning phase.
