# Feature Specification: End-to-End Smart Merge Test with Parallel Execution

**Feature Branch**: `013-e2e-smart-merge-test`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "End-to-End Smart Merge Test with Parallel Execution"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-24

- Q: How should the system handle transient GitHub API failures when downloading SpecKit releases? → A: Fail immediately on first API error (fail fast, no retries)
- Q: What should happen when the system runs out of disk space during parallel test execution? → A: Check available disk space before each test, fail gracefully with cleanup if threshold reached (e.g., less than 100MB free)
- Q: What should happen when an individual merge test exceeds the 5-minute timeout? → A: Terminate the test process, capture available logs/state for debugging, mark as timeout failure, continue tests
- Q: What should happen when downloaded SpecKit templates are corrupted or invalid? → A: Validate basic template integrity after download, skip the specific test if invalid, log details, continue with remaining tests
- Q: What should happen if the fingerprints database is missing or corrupted? → A: Halt test suite immediately with clear error message and instructions for obtaining/repairing the database

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Merge Reliability Validation (Priority: P1)

As a **developer preparing a release**, I need to validate that the smart merge system preserves 100% of user customizations across different SpecKit versions, so that I can confidently ship updates without fear of data loss.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - proving the merge system is reliable. Without this validation, we cannot make claims about data preservation or merge success rates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the test suite against 10 random SpecKit versions with injected customizations and verifying all customizations are preserved. Delivers immediate value by proving merge reliability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project with SpecKit v0.0.50 installed and customized content, **When** the system executes a merge to v0.0.79, **Then** 100% of customizations must be preserved in the final merged files
2. **Given** 15-20 different version upgrade paths (old→middle, middle→recent, old→recent), **When** all merge tests execute, **Then** every test must pass with zero data loss
3. **Given** a merge test execution, **When** the test completes, **Then** a detailed report must show exactly which customizations were tested and whether they were preserved
4. **Given** any merge test failure, **When** reviewing the test output, **Then** the exact files and lost customizations must be identified for debugging

### User Story 2 - Cross-Version Compatibility Testing (Priority: P2)

As a **maintainer of the update system**, I need to test merge scenarios across many different SpecKit versions simultaneously, so that I can identify version-specific issues and ensure broad compatibility.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production confidence but secondary to basic reliability validation. Enables catching version-specific edge cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by stratifying available versions into groups (old/middle/recent), selecting representative samples, and executing merges between them. Delivers value by proving cross-version compatibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 79 available SpecKit versions, **When** the system selects 10 versions for testing, **Then** versions must be stratified across old (2023-2024), middle (mid-2024), and recent (late-2024) timeframes
2. **Given** 10 selected versions, **When** generating test merge pairs, **Then** the system must create diverse upgrade paths including old→recent, old→middle, and middle→recent scenarios
3. **Given** multiple version pairs to test, **When** the system executes tests, **Then** results must show which specific version transitions passed or failed
4. **Given** a version-specific failure, **When** analyzing results, **Then** the report must identify the problematic version transition for targeted debugging

### User Story 3 - Rapid Test Execution with Parallel Processing (Priority: P3)

As a **developer in a fast-paced workflow**, I need the comprehensive test suite to complete in under 15 minutes, so that I can run it frequently without disrupting my development cycle.

**Why this priority**: Important for developer productivity but less critical than correctness. Fast feedback enables more frequent testing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring total execution time for 15-20 merge tests with 4 parallel threads. Delivers value by enabling rapid iteration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 18 merge test scenarios to execute, **When** running tests sequentially, **Then** total execution time would be 45-60 minutes
2. **Given** 18 merge test scenarios to execute, **When** running tests with 4 parallel threads, **Then** total execution time must be under 15 minutes
3. **Given** parallel test execution, **When** multiple tests access shared resources (GitHub API), **Then** access must be coordinated to prevent rate limiting or conflicts
4. **Given** a test suite run completion, **When** reviewing performance metrics, **Then** the report must show average merge time, fastest merge, slowest merge, and total duration

---

### User Story 4 - Semantic Correctness Validation (Priority: P4)

As a **quality assurance engineer**, I need merged files to be validated for semantic correctness beyond just data preservation, so that merged files remain functionally valid and executable.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have enhancement that increases confidence but isn't critical for MVP. Data preservation is more important than perfect structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by validating merged files against structural rules (markdown syntax, required sections, no malformed content). Delivers value by catching corruption issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file after merge, **When** validating its structure, **Then** markdown syntax must be valid and parseable
2. **Given** a merged SpecKit command file, **When** checking for required sections, **Then** all mandatory sections must be present and properly formatted
3. **Given** a merged file with conflict markers, **When** validating structure, **Then** conflict markers must be properly paired (no orphaned markers)
4. **Given** a merged file, **When** testing its usability, **Then** the file must be executable/usable in its domain context (e.g., SpecKit command can be invoked)

---

### User Story 5 - Comprehensive Test Reporting (Priority: P5)

As a **project stakeholder**, I need detailed statistics about merge test results, so that I can understand merge system reliability, performance characteristics, and identify trends.

**Why this priority**: Supporting feature for analysis and communication. The tests themselves are more important than fancy reporting.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running test suite and verifying report contains all required statistics. Delivers value by enabling data-driven decisions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed test suite run, **When** generating the report, **Then** summary statistics must show total tests, pass/fail count, total duration, and overall success rate
2. **Given** test results for each merge pair, **When** reporting per-merge details, **Then** each test must show source version, target version, duration, files tested, customizations preserved, and validation status
3. **Given** multiple test runs over time, **When** comparing reports, **Then** aggregate statistics must enable tracking merge success rate trends, performance improvements, and regression detection
4. **Given** a failed test, **When** reviewing the report, **Then** failure details must include specific files affected, exact customizations lost, and error messages for debugging

### Edge Cases

- **GitHub API failures**: System MUST fail immediately on first API error without retries (fail-fast approach), marking the specific test as failed and continuing with remaining tests
- **Disk space exhaustion**: System MUST check available disk space before each test and fail gracefully with cleanup if available space falls below 100MB threshold
- **Test timeouts**: System MUST terminate test process after 5-minute timeout, capture available logs/state for debugging, mark as timeout failure with distinct error category, and continue with remaining tests
- **Corrupted templates**: System MUST validate basic template integrity (file existence, ZIP integrity, JSON parsing) after download, skip the specific test if invalid with logged details, and continue with remaining tests
- **Missing/corrupted fingerprints database**: System MUST halt immediately with clear error message and instructions for obtaining/repairing the database (essential prerequisite for test execution)
- **Race conditions in parallel execution**: System MUST use isolated test directories (unique GUID-based names) and coordinate shared resource access (e.g., GitHub API via mutex) to prevent conflicts between parallel tests
- **Limited CPU/memory resources**: System honors configurable parallel thread limit (default 4) to balance performance with resource constraints; users can reduce thread count for resource-limited environments
- **Deterministic randomization**: System MUST use fixed seed value (42) for all random number generation to ensure reproducible version selection and merge pair generation across multiple test runs
