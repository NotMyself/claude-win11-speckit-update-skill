# Specification Quality Checklist: End-to-End Smart Merge Test with Parallel Execution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✓ PASSED
- Specification is technology-agnostic, focusing on "WHAT" not "HOW"
- No framework-specific details (though PowerShell 7.0+ and Pester 5.x are documented as constraints/assumptions, which is appropriate)
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✓ PASSED
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- All 15 functional requirements are testable and specific
- All 10 success criteria are measurable with clear metrics
- Success criteria use user-facing language (e.g., "test suite completes in under 15 minutes") not implementation details
- 24 acceptance scenarios defined across 5 user stories
- 8 edge cases identified covering API failures, resource exhaustion, timeouts, race conditions
- Scope is clear: cross-version merge validation with parallel execution
- Assumptions (7 items) and Constraints (6 items) are explicitly documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✓ PASSED
- Each user story has 3-4 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P5) and independently testable
- Success criteria provide measurable outcomes (e.g., 100% data preservation, <15 min execution, <50 API calls)
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language while documenting platform constraints appropriately
