# Specification Quality Checklist: Smart Conflict Resolution for Large Files

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
- **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS - User stories and success criteria focus on user outcomes and measurable results. Technical details are appropriately confined to Dependencies and Technical Constraints sections (which are optional and informational).
- **User value focus**: ✅ PASS - All user stories clearly articulate value ("make informed decisions", "maintains familiar workflow", "clean working directory")
- **Stakeholder accessibility**: ✅ PASS - Language is clear, jargon is explained, technical terms are necessary given the technical nature of the feature
- **Mandatory sections**: ✅ PASS - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all completed

### Requirement Completeness Review
- **No clarifications needed**: ✅ PASS - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Bug report provided comprehensive implementation details.
- **Testable requirements**: ✅ PASS - All FRs are specific and verifiable (e.g., "files with more than 100 lines", "write to `.specify/.tmp-conflicts/`")
- **Measurable success criteria**: ✅ PASS - All SC items include concrete metrics (e.g., "under 2 seconds", "at least 80%", "100% of cases", "95% of updates")
- **Technology-agnostic SC**: ✅ PASS - Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes without specifying implementation technologies. Markdown is mentioned as an output format requirement (not an implementation choice).
- **Acceptance scenarios**: ✅ PASS - Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy path and edge cases
- **Edge cases**: ✅ PASS - Comprehensive edge case list (8 items) with expected behaviors
- **Bounded scope**: ✅ PASS - Out of Scope section clearly defines what is NOT included
- **Dependencies documented**: ✅ PASS - Dependencies and Assumptions sections identify existing modules, constraints, and prerequisites

### Feature Readiness Review
- **Requirements with acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS - User stories provide acceptance scenarios that map to functional requirements
- **User scenarios coverage**: ✅ PASS - Four prioritized user stories cover: large file conflicts (P1), small file handling (P2), cleanup (P3), unchanged sections (P3)
- **Measurable outcomes**: ✅ PASS - 10 success criteria define measurable targets for the feature
- **No implementation leakage**: ✅ PASS - Specification maintains focus on WHAT and WHY. Technical details in Dependencies/Constraints sections are appropriate context for enhancing existing codebase.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification passes all quality validation items. It is well-structured, comprehensive, and provides sufficient detail for implementation planning without prescribing specific code solutions. The feature is clearly scoped with measurable success criteria and thorough edge case coverage.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design artifacts.

## Items Requiring Attention

None - all validation items pass.
