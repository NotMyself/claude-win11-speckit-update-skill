# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Installation Flow to Respect -Proceed Flag

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed validation:

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ Spec avoids implementation details (no mention of specific PowerShell syntax, only references to file paths and line numbers for context)
- ✅ Focused on user value: enabling fresh SpecKit installations, consistent UX, clear guidance
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders: uses plain language to describe workflows and behaviors
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and specific
- ✅ Requirements are testable: Each FR can be verified through specific actions (e.g., FR-001: "parameter exists", FR-004: "exit code is 0")
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable: SC-002 "exactly once", SC-003 "exit code 0", SC-004 "under 2 minutes", SC-005 "100% success rate"
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic: Focus on outcomes like "developer can complete installation" and "prompt appears once" rather than implementation
- ✅ All acceptance scenarios defined: 3 user stories with 3, 3, and 3 scenarios respectively (9 total)
- ✅ Edge cases identified: 4 edge cases covering multiple installations, network failures, corrupt directories, and direct proceed flag usage
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded: Limited to fixing -Proceed flag handling in installation flow, not expanding to other features
- ✅ Dependencies identified: References to existing update flow pattern (lines 381-409), orchestrator call site (line 189), validation helper (lines 206-221)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ Functional requirements linked to acceptance scenarios: FR-004 maps to User Story 1 Scenario 1, FR-005 to Scenario 2, etc.
- ✅ User scenarios cover primary flows: Fresh installation (P1), consistency with updates (P2), error handling (P3)
- ✅ Measurable outcomes align with user scenarios: SC-001 validates P1 workflow completion, SC-007 validates P2 consistency
- ✅ No implementation leakage: References to files/lines are for context only, not prescriptive implementation

## Notes

This specification is **ready for planning** (`/speckit.plan`). No spec updates required before proceeding.

The spec successfully captures a well-defined bug fix with:
- Clear problem statement (installation flow ignores -Proceed flag)
- Specific solution requirements (3 code changes needed)
- Measurable success criteria (8 outcomes)
- Complete test coverage (9 acceptance scenarios + 4 edge cases)

The bug report provided excellent detail, making this specification straightforward to write with high confidence and no ambiguity.
