# Feature Specification: PR Validation Workflow Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `014-pr-validation-enhancement`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "docs\PRDs\007-PR-Validation-Workflow-Enhancement.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Contributor Receives Immediate Security Feedback (Priority: P1)

As a contributor submitting a pull request, I want to receive immediate notification if my code contains security vulnerabilities or exposed secrets so that I can fix critical issues before they are reviewed or merged.

**Why this priority**: Security vulnerabilities and exposed secrets pose the highest risk to the project and users. Early detection prevents sensitive data leaks and security breaches from reaching production. This is the most critical value-add of the enhanced validation workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a PR with an intentional security issue (e.g., hardcoded API key) and verifying that a PR comment appears within 3 minutes identifying the specific issue with file and line number.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I submit a PR that accidentally includes an API key in a file, **When** the validation workflow runs, **Then** a PR comment appears within 3 minutes with the heading "üîí Step 5/6: Claude Security Scan" showing the detected secret with file location and remediation guidance
2. **Given** my code uses `Invoke-Expression` with user input, **When** the security scan runs, **Then** the PR comment identifies this as a security risk and suggests safer alternatives
3. **Given** my code constructs file paths using string concatenation instead of safe path joining, **When** the path traversal check runs, **Then** the PR comment warns about potential directory traversal vulnerabilities with specific line references
4. **Given** all security checks pass, **When** the validation completes, **Then** the PR comment shows "‚úÖ Pass" status with confirmation that no security issues were detected

### User Story 2 - Contributor Ensures Spec Compliance (Priority: P2)

As a contributor working on a feature branch, I want to be reminded if I'm missing required spec documentation or haven't followed the SpecKit workflow so that I can complete all necessary artifacts before review.

**Why this priority**: Spec compliance ensures consistent development practices and complete documentation. While important for project quality, it's less urgent than security issues. However, it's still high priority because incomplete specs waste reviewer time and delay the development process.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a feature branch (e.g., `015-new-feature`) without creating the corresponding spec directory, then submitting a PR and verifying that a comment identifies the missing spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I create a feature branch named `015-new-feature`, **When** I submit a PR without a `specs/015-new-feature/` directory, **Then** a PR comment identifies that the spec directory is missing and provides guidance on creating it with `/speckit.specify`
2. **Given** my spec directory exists but is missing `tasks.md`, **When** the validation runs, **Then** the PR comment lists `tasks.md` as missing and suggests running `/speckit.tasks` to generate it
3. **Given** I modify a module file but don't create a corresponding test file, **When** the validation runs, **Then** the PR comment shows an informational warning listing modified modules without test updates
4. **Given** I forget to update CHANGELOG.md, **When** the validation runs, **Then** the PR comment reminds me to add an entry under the `[Unreleased]` section
5. **Given** I create a new module without `Export-ModuleMember`, **When** the constitution compliance check runs, **Then** the PR comment flags this violation with a link to the relevant constitution rule

### User Story 3 - Maintainer Reviews Consolidated Validation Results (Priority: P2)

As a project maintainer reviewing a pull request, I want to see all validation results consolidated in the PR conversation so that I can make informed merge decisions without digging through workflow logs.

**Why this priority**: Maintainer efficiency directly impacts project velocity. Consolidating validation results in the PR conversation reduces context switching and makes review faster. This is high priority because it impacts every PR review, but doesn't block contributors from submitting PRs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a PR that triggers multiple validation warnings (e.g., large size + missing CHANGELOG entry), then verifying that all results appear as separate comments in the PR conversation with clear status indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR has completed all validation steps, **When** I view the PR conversation, **Then** I see 5 separate comments (Steps 2-6) each with a numbered heading (e.g., "üìè Step 2/6: Size and Description")
2. **Given** a validation step has failed, **When** I view the PR comment, **Then** the comment shows a clear status indicator (‚ö†Ô∏è Warning or ‚ùå Failed) and lists specific issues with actionable remediation guidance
3. **Given** all validation steps pass, **When** I view the PR comments, **Then** each comment shows "‚úÖ Pass" status confirming the step succeeded
4. **Given** validation results are non-blocking failures, **When** I attempt to merge the PR, **Then** the merge is not prevented (all checks are informational)
5. **Given** I need to understand a specific validation failure, **When** I view the PR comment, **Then** the comment includes links to relevant documentation or constitution rules explaining the requirement

### User Story 4 - Contributor Updates PR Without Comment Spam (Priority: P3)

As a contributor fixing issues found by validation, I want the PR comments to update in place rather than creating duplicates so that the PR conversation remains clean and readable.

**Why this priority**: Comment cleanliness is important for user experience but doesn't block functionality. Contributors can still receive feedback and fix issues even if comments duplicate. This is lower priority than security, spec compliance, and consolidated results.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a PR that fails validation, then pushing a fix commit, and verifying that the validation comments update in place (showing new timestamps) rather than creating duplicate comments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I submit a PR that fails size validation, **When** the first validation runs, **Then** a comment is created with status "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning" and a timestamp
2. **Given** I push a fix commit that reduces PR size, **When** the validation runs again, **Then** the existing size validation comment updates to show "‚úÖ Pass" with a new timestamp instead of creating a second comment
3. **Given** I have fixed 2 of 3 security issues, **When** the validation runs, **Then** the security scan comment updates to show 1 remaining issue instead of showing all 3 again
4. **Given** a PR has gone through 5 commits, **When** I view the PR conversation, **Then** I see exactly 5 validation comments (Steps 2-6), not 25 comments (5 steps √ó 5 commits)
5. **Given** a validation comment has been updated, **When** I view the comment, **Then** the timestamp at the bottom shows when it was last updated

### User Story 5 - Contributor Receives Size and Description Feedback (Priority: P3)

As a contributor submitting a pull request, I want to receive feedback if my PR is too large or has an insufficient description so that I can improve PR quality before review.

**Why this priority**: PR size and description quality affect review efficiency but are less critical than security or spec compliance. Large PRs and poor descriptions slow down reviews but don't pose security risks or violate project standards. This is lower priority informational feedback.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a PR with only 10 characters in the description and verifying that a comment appears suggesting a more detailed description.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** my PR modifies 350 lines of code, **When** the size validation runs, **Then** the PR comment shows "‚úÖ Pass" because it's within the 2000 line limit
2. **Given** my PR modifies 2500 lines of code, **When** the size validation runs, **Then** the PR comment shows "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning" suggesting I consider splitting the PR into smaller chunks
3. **Given** my PR description is only 10 characters long, **When** the description validation runs, **Then** the PR comment warns that the description is too short (below 20 character minimum) and suggests adding more context
4. **Given** my PR has a comprehensive description and reasonable size, **When** the validation runs, **Then** the PR comment shows "‚úÖ Pass" with confirmation of the line count and file count

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a PR is from a non-spec branch** (e.g., `bugfix/typo-in-readme`)?
  - Spec validation should detect that the branch doesn't follow the `NNN-feature-name` pattern and skip spec directory validation, but still check for CHANGELOG.md updates

- **What happens when validation steps fail to run** (e.g., network timeout)?
  - The workflow should handle failures gracefully and post a comment indicating that the validation step couldn't complete, providing instructions for manual retry

- **What happens when a contributor pushes multiple commits in quick succession**?
  - The workflow should debounce or queue validation runs to avoid race conditions where multiple workflows try to update the same comment simultaneously

- **What happens when GitLeaks or other tools generate extremely large output**?
  - The comment formatting should truncate long outputs with a summary (e.g., "10 secrets detected, showing first 5") and provide a link to full workflow logs

- **What happens when a PR modifies the validation scripts themselves**?
  - The workflow should use the version of validation scripts from the base branch (not the PR branch) to prevent contributors from bypassing validation

- **What happens when the GitHub token lacks permissions to post comments**?
  - The workflow should detect the permission issue and log an error to workflow output, alerting maintainers that PR commenting is not functional
