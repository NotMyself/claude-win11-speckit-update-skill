# Specification Quality Checklist: PR Validation Workflow Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items satisfied

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, avoiding HOW. No mention of GitLeaks, PSScriptAnalyzer, GitHub Actions, or specific tools.
- ✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly state the value (security, compliance, efficiency, cleanliness).
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for product managers and stakeholders, not developers.
- ✅ **Mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria all present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are complete and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-005 "within 3 minutes" is measurable, FR-012 about Export-ModuleMember is binary).
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC entries include specific metrics (90% detection rate, 100% update success, 3-minute feedback time).
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic SC**: Success criteria describe user outcomes, not system internals (e.g., "Contributors receive feedback within 3 minutes" vs "GitHub Actions completes in 3 minutes").
- ✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 4-5 Given-When-Then scenarios covering success and failure paths.
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases documented including non-spec branches, network failures, race conditions, large outputs, script modifications, and permission issues.
- ✅ **Clear scope**: Spec focuses on validation workflow enhancement, boundaries are clear (e.g., non-blocking except authorization, PR-level only).
- ✅ **Dependencies noted**: Implicit dependencies on existing PR validation infrastructure and GitHub commenting permissions.

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: All 20 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories.
- ✅ **Primary flows covered**: 5 user stories cover the critical flows: security feedback (P1), spec compliance (P2), maintainer review (P2), comment updates (P3), size/description feedback (P3).
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: All 10 success criteria are specific, measurable, and aligned with user story goals.
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec successfully avoids mentioning tools, frameworks, or technical approaches.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All user stories are independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria provide concrete targets for measuring feature success
- Edge cases ensure robust handling of common failure scenarios
- No blocking issues identified
