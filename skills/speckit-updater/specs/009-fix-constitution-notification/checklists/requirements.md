# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix False Constitution Update Notification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on behavior and outcomes without mentioning PowerShell specifics, module internals, or code structure.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate the problem (false positives, confusion) and value (trust, accuracy, clarity).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for stakeholders - uses plain language like "system should not display notification" rather than technical implementation details.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria all fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: Specification contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are fully specified.

✅ **Testable requirements**: All FR-001 through FR-012 are testable with clear verification criteria:
- FR-001: Can verify notification only shown after hash comparison
- FR-002: Can verify normalized hash function is called
- FR-003: Can verify notification suppressed when hashes match
- FR-004: Can verify notification shown when hashes differ
- etc.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC-001 through SC-006 include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "Zero false positives" (100% elimination)
- SC-003: "within 3 seconds of reading"
- SC-004: "less than 100ms"
- SC-005: "95% of users"
- SC-006: "80% reduction"

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of PowerShell, modules, or implementation - all criteria focus on user-observable outcomes.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: All three user stories have detailed Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios (3 scenarios per story).

✅ **Edge cases identified**: Four edge cases documented with expected behaviors:
- Missing backup directory
- Hash normalization differences
- Missing constitution file
- Hash function errors

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Feature limited to constitution notification logic in Step 12 - doesn't expand to other template files or general notification system.

✅ **Dependencies identified**: Clear dependency on existing `Get-NormalizedHash` function from HashUtils module (FR-006).

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: Three user stories cover all primary scenarios:
- P1: False positive suppression (core bug fix)
- P2: Real update notification (informational)
- P3: Conflict notification (required action)

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Six success criteria provide clear metrics for feature success.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction - closest to implementation is mentioning "normalized file hashes" and color schemes for output, which are observable behaviors, not implementation details.

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and technology-agnostic. No clarifications needed. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with rationale (P1 = core bug, P2 = improvement, P3 = enhancement)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Measurable success criteria with specific percentages and time limits
- Well-defined fail-safe behaviors

**No Issues Found**: Specification meets all quality standards on first validation.
