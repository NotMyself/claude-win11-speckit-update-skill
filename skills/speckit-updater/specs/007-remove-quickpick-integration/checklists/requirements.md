# Specification Quality Checklist: Remove VSCode QuickPick Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All items passed on first validation.

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with 4 user stories (P1, P2, P2, P3)
- Each user story has independent test criteria
- 15 testable functional requirements with specific file/line references
- 7 measurable success criteria with quantifiable metrics
- Edge cases comprehensively identified
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - specification is complete

**Technical References Justified**:
The specification includes specific file paths and line numbers (e.g., VSCodeIntegration.psm1 lines 55-143) which might appear implementation-focused. However, these are justified because:
1. This is a **refactoring/cleanup feature**, not new functionality
2. References identify **what to remove**, not how to implement new features
3. The context is fixing a documented architectural limitation
4. User stories focus on outcomes (working `-Auto` flag, clear errors, clean codebase)

**Ready for Next Phase**: The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - no clarifications needed.
